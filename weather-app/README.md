# Simple Weather App

This is a simpel weather app using React.

Weather data is retrieved by using openweathermap API.

City search form component is using an API that I personally created since openweathermap did not provide such API.

You can find more about the API that city search form is using at [OpenWeather-Backend repository](https://github.com/Miafargo/OpenWeather-Backend)

## Available Scripts
